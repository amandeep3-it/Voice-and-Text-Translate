# Voice and Text Translate - Java

A Java Android application to enhance and develop `Java` and Android application development skills. Learning goals were to practise Java fundamentals and asynchronous network calls. Data flow and state management of the application was also well practised.

## Description

The application is to translate manually entered and speech extracted text to any selected language. The application utilised asynchronous network calls to the Google Translate API and extracts the translated text. The text is displayed and can be read aloud by the device's speakers.
